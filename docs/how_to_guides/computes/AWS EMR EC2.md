Guzzle supports Computing environments on the AWS Cloud. In Guzzle aws cloud setup, we can use AWS EMR EC2 to execute our workloads. This article helps in using AWS ECR EC2 as a computing environment in Guzzle.
:::note
AWS EMR EC2 compute can be used when guzzle is running from AWS EC2 instance
:::

## Run jobs in AWS EMR EC2
- To run a job in EMR EC2 compute user has to create AWS IAM role from AWS console.
1. User has to create AWS IAM role for ec2 instance with following access permissions
    - Secret Manager -> to access the secret values
        - GetSecretValue
        - UpdateSecret
        - CreateSecret
    - Glue -> to submit job and access the jobs
        - CreateJob
        - UpdateJob
        - StartJobRun
        - GetJobRun
        - GetJob
        - GetConnections
    - ElasticMapReducer -> all permissions
    - iam:PassRole
2. User has to create AWS IAM role for EMR EC2 with following access permissions
    - s3 -> to access the jar files of guzzle and the job definition
        - all permissions
    - Secrets Manager -> to access the secret values
        - GetSecretValue
    - Glue -> to access of the database and tables
        - all permissions
    - iam:PassRole
    - ElasticMap Reducer
        - all the permissions
